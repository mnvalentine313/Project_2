## Technical Requirements - Performing

Full CRUD functionality is present on one or two models.

- Nice job!

## Creativity and Interface - Performing

The app displays a personal spin or creative element through its written language, functionality, purpose, and/or CSS.

- It looks really good in the browser! If you have time in the future, consider using CSS technologies like Grid/Flexbox/media queries to make your app even more responsive on mobile.
- The white font is a little hard to read against the light blue background. Consider increasing the contrast by picking a different font-color.

## Code Quality - Excelling

No major code quality issues, makes use of JS best practices appropriately, and follows techniques such as separation of concerns, abstraction, and encapsulation

- Nice job separating out your files into models, views, and controllers!

## Functionality - Performing

Application contains no major errors.

## Planning/Process/Submission - Performing

Submission contains clear evidence of planning, adequate documentation, include all from previous category, as well as additional information such as unsolved issues. Submission includes a readme and planning directory.

- Your readme is also informative! I thought the format made a lot of sense and was easy to understand.

## Additional Feedback
